### Opening (Chris or Group Representative)  
Hello everyone, thank you for being here.  
Today, our group will introduce our research topic: **Robotics in Chip Testing and Sorting**.  
This topic is important because semiconductor chips are the core of almost every electronic device, and testing and sorting them efficiently is a major challenge.  

We are exploring how industrial robotics, combined with machine vision, can improve the accuracy, speed, and reliability of this process.  
Each of us will explain one part of this study, from background to concepts, technologies, and finally its value and impact.

### Chris – Background & Research Question  
Hi everyone, I’m Chris.  
Let me start with the background of our project.  
In semiconductor manufacturing, chip testing and sorting are critical steps because chips are very small, complex, and fragile.  
Manual processes are often slow, expensive, and prone to errors.  

That’s why we are exploring robotics combined with machine vision to automate these processes.  
Our research question is:  
**In what ways does the integration of industrial robotics and machine vision enhance accuracy and efficiency in semiconductor chip testing and sorting?**

### Swayne – Achievements, Innovations & Integration  
Hi, I’m Swayne.  
Now I will explain the innovations and technological integration.  

Robotics can precisely handle fragile chips and carry out automated testing protocols.  
When integrated with machine vision, robots can detect defects, classify chips, and even use AI-based optimization to improve accuracy.  

This combination significantly increases throughput and reduces errors compared to manual work.  
The novelty lies in merging robotics, microelectronics, and measurement technologies to make the entire process faster and more reliable.

### Allen – Value, Impact & Future Outlook  
Hello everyone, I’m Allen.  
Finally, let’s look at the value and impact.  

Robotic testing and sorting improve chip reliability, lower production costs, and make the semiconductor supply chain stronger.  
This is especially important today, as semiconductors are the backbone of all electronic devices.  

Faster and more accurate testing also means quicker innovation and shorter time-to-market.  
In the future, with AI and smarter robotics, we expect even greater efficiency and more sustainable production in the semiconductor industry.
